# University Files
## DISCLAIMER
**ANY COURSEWORK OR PRIVATE FILES INCLUDED HERE ARE EXPIRED. I AM NOT SHARING ANY COURSEWORK FILES WHOSE DEADLINES ARE YET TO PASS**
## Overview
This repository used to contain all of my university files, including coursework.. Coursework has been extracted to individual repositories and the LaTeX notes kept here since they each have dependencies in this repository. This will now only contain my pure LaTeX notes and so I am renaming this from "University" to "University-Notes"

## Related Repositories
Keep in mind, not all courses warranted full GitHub repositories or did not allow for publishing of coursework at all, and as such I either only have notes from these courses here, or no trace of them whatsover online.

### Year 1
Related Course Name| Repository | Description |
 --- | --- | --- 
Informatics 1 - Introduction to Computation| [UoE Functional Programming Competition winning entry](https://github.com/makspll/Newton-Fractals) | An introduction to concepts of programming, using a functional programming language, and to concepts of computation and specification using finite-state systems and propositional logic. These provide examples of the logical ideas of syntax and semantics and the computational ideas of structure and behaviour. Students learn to specify, model and solve small-scale problems succinctly and at an abstract level.
