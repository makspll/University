PART 1

Task 1.1
Atemporal predicates:

    LOCATION(x) - true iff x is a location,
    LAND_ROUTE(x,y) - true iff x,y are locations and there is a road between x and y or y and x,
    AIR_ROUTE(x,y) - true iff x,y are locations and there exists a flight taking you from x to y

Fluent predicates:

    visited(x) - true iff x is a location and the agent has visited it
    agent_at(x) - true iff x is a location and the agent is currently there
    car_at(x) -  true iff x is a location and the agent is currently there
